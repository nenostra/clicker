This is my attempt of a Cookie Clicker clone (http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). Made this project just to learn the bassic structure and best practices of a ReactJS web application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To try:

-Open command line.

-git clone https://github.com/nenostra/clicker.git

-cd clicker.

-npm install.

-npm start.
